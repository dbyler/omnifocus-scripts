	# CHANGE HISTORY #
	
	2017-04-23
	-	Fixes an issue when running with certain top-level category separators selected
	-	Minor update to notification code

	0.5.1 (2015-05-17)
	-	Use Notification Center instead of an alert when not running Growl. Requires Mountain Lion or newer
	
	0.5 (2015-05-07)
	-	Support passing # of days through LaunchBar and Alfred (unsupported)
	-	Support snoozing for a fraction of a day. You can use decimals (.01 days is about 15 minutes)
		or fractions (1/24 = 1 hour)	
	-	Shout out to Bill Palmer for an elegant way to snooze without counting seconds in a day
	
	0.4.1 (2011-10-31)
	-	Updated Growl code to work with Growl 1.3 (App Store version)
	-	Updated tell syntax to call "first document window", not "front document window"
	
	0.4 (2011-08-30)
	-	Rewrote notification code to gracefully handle situations where Growl is not installed
	-	Changed "The item/The items" to "It/They"
	
	0.3 (2011-07-07)
	-	New option to set start time (default: 8am)
	-	Reorganized; incorporated Rob Trew's method to get items from OmniFocus
	-	No longer fails when a Grouping divider is selected
	-	Fixes potential issue when launching from OmniFocus toolbar
	
	0.2.2 (2010-06-22)
	-	Actual fix for autosave
	
	0.2.1 (2010-06-21)
	-	Encapsulated autosave in "try" statements in case this fails
	
	0.2 (2010-06-15)
	-	Fixed Growl code
	-	Added performance optimization (thanks, Curt Clifton)
	-	Changed from LGPL to MIT license (MIT is less restrictive)
		
	0.1: Original release. (Thanks to Curt Clifton, Nanovivid, and Macfaninpdx for various pieces of code)

	
	# INSTALLATION #
	
	-	Copy to ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Omnifocus
 	-	If desired, add to the OmniFocus toolbar using View > Customize Toolbar... within OmniFocus

	
	# KNOWN ISSUES #
	-	When the script is invoked from the OmniFocus toolbar and canceled, OmniFocus displays an alert.
		This does not occur when invoked from another launcher (script menu, FastScripts LaunchBar, etc).
