	# DESCRIPTION #

	This script takes the currently selected actions or projects and sets them for action tomorrow.
	
	**IMPORTANT: Now has two modes: "Start" mode and "Due" mode. Start mode is for people
	who use start dates to plan for the day; Due mode is for people who use Due dates for the same.
	It is now my opinion that Start dates are more useful for day-to-day planning, but this script is 
	intended to provide flexibility in whatever system you use.
	
	By default, this script will now set start dates, but you can change this in the settings below.**

	## START MODE LOGIC ##
	For each item:
		- If no original due date, sets due to tomorrow at the set time

	## DUE MODE LOGIC ##
	For each item:
	-	If there's no existing due date: sets Due to tomorrow (at time specified in script settings)
	-	If there's an existing due date: sets Due to tomorrow at the *original* due time
	-	If there's an existing due date AND start date: advances start date by same # of days as due 
		date (this is to respect parameters of repeating actions)
	-	Ignores start date if there's no due date already assigned to a task

	# CHANGE HISTORY #

	2020-02-14
	-	Updated for OmniFocus 3; removes Growl support; other small improvements

	2017-04-22
	-	Fixes an issue when running with certain top-level category separators selected
	-	Minor update to notification code

	0.42 (2015-05-17)
	-	Use Notification Center instead of an alert when not running Growl. Requires Mountain Lion or newer

	0.41 (2011-10-31)
	-	Updated Growl code to work with Growl 1.3 (App Store version)
	-	Updated tell syntax to call "first document window", not "front document window"

	0.4 (2011-08-30)
	-	Rewrote notification code to gracefully handle situations where Growl is not installed
	
	0.3 (2011-07-07):
	-	New setting: "Start" or "Due" modes (see above)
	-	No longer fails when a Grouping divider is selected
	-	Streamlined calls to OmniFocus with Rob Trew's input (Thanks, Rob!)
	-	Reorganized script for better readability

	0.2c (2010-06-22)
	-	Actual fix for autosave

	0.2b (2010-06-21)
	-	Encapsulated autosave in "try" statements in case this fails

	0.2 (2010-06-15)
	-	Added performance optimization (thanks to Curt Clifton)
	-	Fixed Growl code (broke with Snow Leopard)
	-	Switched to MIT license (simpler, less restrictive)

	0.1: Initial release. Based on my Defer script, which incorporates bug fixes from Curt Clifton. Also uses method that doesn't call Growl directly. This code should be friendly for machines that don't have Growl installed. In my testing, I found that GrowlHelperApp crashes on nearly 10% of AppleScript calls, so the script checks for GrowlHelperApp and launches it if not running. (Thanks to Nanovivid from forums.cocoaforge.com/viewtopic.php?p=32584 and Macfaninpdx from forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=423718 for the information needed to get this working

	# INSTALLATION #

	-	Copy to ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Omnifocus
 	-	If desired, add to the OmniFocus toolbar using View > Customize Toolbar... within OmniFocus

	# KNOWN BUGS #
	-	When the script is invoked from the OmniFocus toolbar and canceled, OmniFocus returns an error. This issue does not occur when invoked from the script menu, a Quicksilver trigger, etc.
